# Mascot Background Removal Guide

To get the best results with your animated mascot, you should remove the white/beige background from the mascot image.

## Quick Options

### Option 1: Use remove.bg (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.remove.bg/
2. Upload your mascot image: `/Users/oduduabasivictor/Downloads/ChatGPT Image Oct 23, 2025 at 06_54_56 PM.png`
3. Download the PNG with transparent background
4. Replace the image in `Preppi AI/Assets.xcassets/PreppiMascot.imageset/`

### Option 2: Use Photoshop/GIMP
1. Open the mascot image in Photoshop or GIMP
2. Use the Magic Wand or Select by Color tool to select the background
3. Delete the background
4. Export as PNG with transparency
5. Replace the image in `Preppi AI/Assets.xcassets/PreppiMascot.imageset/`

### Option 3: Use Python Script (Advanced)
If you have Python installed:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install pillow rembg

# Run the background removal script
python3 remove_background.py

# Deactivate virtual environment when done
deactivate
```

### Option 4: Ask ChatGPT/DALL-E
Since the image was generated by ChatGPT/DALL-E:
1. Go back to ChatGPT
2. Ask it to regenerate the same mascot image but with a transparent background
3. Save and replace the current image

## After Removing Background

Once you have the transparent PNG:
1. Replace the file in `Preppi AI/Assets.xcassets/PreppiMascot.imageset/ChatGPT Image Oct 23, 2025 at 06_54_56 PM.png`
2. Or add it as a new file and update the `Contents.json` to point to it
3. Rebuild the app and enjoy your mascot without the background!

## Current Implementation

The mascot now has:
- ✅ Waving animation on the welcome screen
- ✅ Talking animation when speaking
- ✅ Walking and idle animations ready to use
- ✅ Australian accent text-to-speech
- ⏳ Transparent background (pending your action)

The mascot will automatically wave when the welcome screen appears and then speak the welcome message in an Australian accent!
