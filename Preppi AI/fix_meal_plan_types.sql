-- =============================================================================
-- FIX MEAL PLAN TYPES - Update existing meal plans to have correct meal types
-- =============================================================================
-- This script will help distribute existing meal plans across different meal types
-- Run this ONLY if the diagnostic shows all meal plans have meal_plan_type = "dinner"
-- =============================================================================

-- OPTION 1: Manual Update (RECOMMENDED)
-- Update specific meal plans to be breakfast or lunch based on their IDs
-- First, let's see all your current meal plans so you can choose which ones to update

SELECT 
    'Your current meal plans (choose which to update):' as info,
    id,
    name,
    meal_plan_type,
    week_start_date,
    created_at
FROM public.meal_plans
WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- MANUAL UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:
-- 1. Look at the meal plans above
-- 2. Choose which ones you want to be breakfast, lunch, or dinner
-- 3. Update them using the queries below (replace the UUIDs with actual IDs)

-- Example: Update a specific meal plan to be breakfast
-- UPDATE public.meal_plans 
-- SET meal_plan_type = 'breakfast' 
-- WHERE id = 'YOUR-MEAL-PLAN-ID-HERE' AND user_id = auth.uid();

-- Example: Update a specific meal plan to be lunch  
-- UPDATE public.meal_plans 
-- SET meal_plan_type = 'lunch' 
-- WHERE id = 'YOUR-MEAL-PLAN-ID-HERE' AND user_id = auth.uid();

-- =============================================================================
-- OPTION 2: Automatic Distribution (USE WITH CAUTION)
-- Automatically distribute your most recent 3 meal plans across breakfast, lunch, dinner
-- ONLY run this if you want automatic distribution
-- =============================================================================

-- Uncomment and run this ONLY if you want automatic distribution:
